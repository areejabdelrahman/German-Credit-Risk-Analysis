# German Credit Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores how demographic and financial characteristics are related to credit risk indicators in the German Credit dataset. The goal is to identify patterns in borrowing behavior and financial stability that may be associated with higher risk.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about 1,000 loan applicants, including:
- Age
- Sex
- Job level
- Housing status
- Saving and checking account categories
- Credit amount
- Loan duration
- Loan purpose

## Key Questions
- How does credit amount vary by savings level?
- Does employment type (job level) relate to loan size?
- Are certain loan purposes associated with higher credit amounts?
- Does age affect loan duration?

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Clients with lower savings tend to take higher credit amounts, indicating potentially higher repayment risk.
- Higher job levels are associated with larger loans, suggesting that employment stability increases borrowing capacity.
- Certain loan purposes are linked to higher borrowing amounts.
- Age does not appear to strongly influence loan duration.

## Conclusion
Financial stability indicators such as savings and employment level play an important role in credit access and borrowing behavior. These patterns highlight how lenders implicitly evaluate economic security when granting loans.
